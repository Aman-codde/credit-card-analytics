# routes

This folder contains all Express route handlers.

Organized by feature:

- `authRoutes.js` – Routes for user registration, login, logout
- `transactionRoutes.js` – Routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting transactions

Each file uses `express.Router()` to define endpoints and connects to the appropriate controller.
